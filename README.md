# Movie-Recs

## Description 
A simple movie recommender where a user selects up to 3 genres, then has a movie or TV show recommended to them based on the most popular results within those specified genres. They are also given a link they can click to watch the trailer. They can save any result, and at a later time, pull it back up with a simple click of a button.

We built this because we felt there weren't any good movie recommender apps or websites, and felt we could create a simple-to-use website with a smooth interface.

## Usage 

Select remote to reveal genres. Select up to 3 genres, then click "Suggest My Movie!". Doing this will reveal a suggested movie for you. If you wish to save that movie for future reference, select "Save Movie". You can show this saved movie at any time by clicking "Saved movie".
