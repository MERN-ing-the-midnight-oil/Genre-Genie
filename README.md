## Background

This project is a fork from a group project, [Movie Recs](https://hayni100.github.io/Movie-Recs/). The initial part of the original Movie Recs project that I worked on involved handling API calls. However, Genre-Genie has been greatly expanded upon, with almost all of the code updated and many features added, resulting in an application that is significantly more complex than the original.

The project showcases a clear understanding of frontend development, particularly in the use of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and API calls. It also demonstrates proficiency in using local storage.

The API used in this project is Advanced Movie Search, which is leveraged to provide the unique movie suggestions based on the genres selected by the user.

## Features

- Selection of various movie genres by toggling genre buttons.
- A 'Magic Lamp' that when rubbed (mouse click and movement over the lamp for an accumulated time of 4 seconds) will provide a movie recommendation fitting the selected genres.
- An animated magic lamp that reacts to the user's interaction.
- Saved Movies List - Functional links to movie information saved in local storage and associated delete buttons.
- All images (except the Magic Lamp button) on the website were created by Rhys Smoker.

## Installation

Since this is a web application, it doesn't require any installation. You can visit the application [here](https://mern-ing-the-midnight-oil.github.io/Genre-Genie/).

## Usage

1. Visit the website.
2. Toggle your desired movie genres.
3. Rub the magic lamp for an accumulated time of 4 seconds.

5. Repeat the process for new recommendations or delete any you don't want from the saved movies list.
